title:  "Andy's Resignation"
---
We're sad to announce that our VP and co-founder Andy will be stepping down to pursue an unmissable opportunity.

We'd like to thank him for all the hard work he's put into the society over the past year, we wouldn't be where we are today without him!

We will be holding an emergency election next Wednesday at 13:15 to elect a new VP! More information is available [here](https://forms.gle/tE7jwFhTNq2TQ4e87)

If you have any questions don't hesitate to email us!
